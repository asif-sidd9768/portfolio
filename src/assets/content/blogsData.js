      {text: 'Every day I see many people crying, yelling at someone, sad, and frustrated, because they\’re not happy with their Life, not getting what they want, someone\'s living a better life than them. The main reason for unhappiness is a comparison, we always tend to compare our own selves with others. If you go out and ask these people why you\’re not happy? or what\’s bothering you?, in reply, you\’ll get some shitty reasons.'},
      {text: 'So again, Why we are not happy with our lives? And the answer lies inside of us, astonished? Don’t be. What? How? Our happiness is entirely dependent on the way we respond, react to any event. There exist two ways to consider anything, i.e. Positive and negative.'},
      {text: 'Beliefs are the most important part of one\'s life, they\’re the core of our thoughts, they control the way we act, feel and think. If we always think of bad beliefs, we see the bad things happening all around us.'},
      {text: 'Expectations can be both good and bad, depending on what we expect. Successful people expect to be happy and successful, and they will become. Unhappy people expect bad things, they see world pessimistically and always hope for something awful to happen.'},
      {text: 'We ourself are responsible for everything happening in our life, we have control of everything, irrespective of good or bad, but we can control them. For that we don’t need weapons, military or anything just fill up your mind with positive, hopeful, good thoughts and beliefs. Expect good things to happen, find good in bad. Everything happens for a reason and you can learn from them, create learners attitude, because as Warren Buffet said....'}

      {text: 'Yippee! I got passed in exams, I got a girlfriend, I\’m doing quite well in my life.”, “I have a loving family.”, and much more. Every day we say these phrases or at least one of them to our friends, relatives or family members and feel the joy, but for how much time does that joy remains maybe minutes, hours, or at the most a day.'},
      {text: 'Gratitude contributes to our happiness and joy, and this contribution is too crucial for our life because, without gratitude and thankfulness, we’ll never stay happy. Suppose... CASE 1: you’ve worked really hard and reached your goal, whether it’s to earn million dollars. or to buy expensive cars. or to roam around the world. after achieving your goal, instead of thinking, if you desire for more and look at others and think that they have more, you’ll never gonna enjoy and be happy for what you have. CASE 2: If you have only $10 in your pocket and still you’re happy and thankful for that, you’ll stay happier than the person who has millions of dollars but no gratitude.'},
      {text: 'Thank the creator of the everything because your heart is still beating, that means you’re still alive. How great this single phrase is “You’re still alive”. ——> Thank the creator of everything for giving you this beautiful heart that beats for almost a hundred thousands times a day, even when you sleep. ——> Thank the creator of the everything because many people around you have died, how blissful it’s that you\'re still alive. And there are infinite reasons. Showing gratitude is easier done than said.'},
      {text: 'When you wake up in the morning, sit on the chair, close your eyes and remember 2-3 flashes of your life and say “thanks”. Try to feel that moments as they are happening, try to involve yourself in that events.'}
