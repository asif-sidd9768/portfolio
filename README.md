# Mark 4 (Portfolio)
Speaking about our work is good but it's impact is not that great, we need a proof of work to show people what we've built or achieved. <br/>
A **Portfolio** is what shows our work and achievements. This has all the marks with the links to their git repo and live working. <br/>
- It has homepage that shows a bit about me.
- A marks page that has a list or all the marks built by me.
- Each mark has button to navigate to github repo or open the project (and a third button to open the live project in new tab).
- A blogs page that shows the blogs writted by me.
- Each blog has it's own detail page.
- It also consist of Social Media links. (Github, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram)

> **NOTE** : This website is best for Desktop view. (not yet optimized for Mobile View)
